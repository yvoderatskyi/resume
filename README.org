#+TITLE: My resume
#+AUTHOR: Yurii Voderatskyi
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Why?
  I could not find a good way to make a nice looking so decided to create one
  using [[https://www.latex-project.org/][LaTeX]] and the beautiful skin - [[https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV][AltaCV]].

* How to build?
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    pdflatex resume.tex
  #+END_SRC
